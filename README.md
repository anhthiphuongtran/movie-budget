# Investigate the relation between Movie Budget and Box Office Revenue

## About
* This project will examine whether movie production budget exhibits a positive relationship with box office revenue. To achieve this target, I will employ data of 6,000 movies extracted from the website: [the-numbers.com](https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/budgets), using particularly the table concerning Biggest Budgets movies.

* In this project, I will conduct data exploration and cleaning, data visualisation and analysis as well as data prediction.

## Dependencies:

1. Python v3.x is required.
2. Pandas library is employed to read and handle the data.
3. Matplotlib and Seaborn library is required to visualise the data.
4. Scikit-learn library is used to build a linear regression model, and consequently predict data.
